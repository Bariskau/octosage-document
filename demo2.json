    "content": "After establishing that our mood time series responds to significant socio-cultural events such as the Presidential Election and Thanksgiving, we are concerned with the question whether other variations of the public's mood state correlate with changes in the stock market, in particular DJIA closing values. To answer this question, we apply the econometric technique of Granger causality analysis to the daily time series produced by GPOMS and OpinionFinder vs. the DJIA. Granger causality analysis rests on the assumption that if a variable X causes Y then changes in X will systematically occur before changes in Y . We will thus find that the lagged values of X will exhibit a statistically significant correlation with Y . Correlation however does not prove causation. We therefore use Granger causality analysis in a similar fashion to [17];we are not testing actual causation but whether one time series has predictive information about the other or not. 8",

To test whether our mood time series predicts changes in stock market values we compare the variance explained by two linear models as shown in Eqs. (3) and (4).
